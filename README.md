## User Guide
* Start the program by running "Run.bat".
  * A Windows CMD window will open, leave it or minimize it for as long as you want to run the program to record locations.
  * Click anywhere in the CMD window (put it in focus), then press **CTL + C** to stop it.

### Requirements
* Java
  * To check if you already have it, start CMD / Command Prompt (Windows flag, type "cmd", press Enter)
    * Type "java -version", if you have it, its version will be displayed instead of an error message saying it doesn't know what "java" is.
  * Can be downloaded from: https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp

## Goals
* Be a simple application for assisting players mapping the game world of Pantheon.
  * Write locations stored in clipboard to a ".scv" file to limit the manual steps needed.
* Be usable by a somewhat technical user and not just programmers.
